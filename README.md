My first github repository
Myself N Dheeraj Nag, studying in Btech Metallurgical and Materials Engineering is aspiring young mind to become a great engineer by professsion and a great person by behaviour. As a young adult I want to dedicate all my free time to something productive which will help my pass time and learn something new at the same time. I have great interest in electronics and material science as I like to explore new things and technology. On a narrow scale my interest lies in Nano technology. I have keen interest in civil service and management. My main motive is to learn allround skills and personality development.
